## Documentation
### Python Turtle Programming


Turtle is a Python library which used to create graphics, pictures, and games. It was developed by Wally Feurzeig, Seymour Parpet and Cynthina Slolomon in 1967. It was a part of the original Logo programming language.

### Introduction

Turtle is a pre-installed library in Python that is similar to the virtual canvas that we can draw pictures and attractive shapes. 
It provides the onscreen pen that we can use for drawing.

### Getting started with turtle

Before working with the turtle library, we must ensure the two most essential things to do programming.

- Python Environment - We must be familiar with the working Python environment. We can use applications such as IDLE or Jupiter Notebook. We can also use the Python interactive shell.
- Python Version - We must have Python 3 in our system; if not, then download it from Python's official website.

The turtle is built in library so we don't need to install separately. We just need to import the library into our Python environment.
